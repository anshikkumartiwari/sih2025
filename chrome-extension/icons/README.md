# Simple icon creation instructions

The Chrome extension needs three icon sizes:
- 16x16 pixels (icon16.png)
- 48x48 pixels (icon48.png) 
- 128x128 pixels (icon128.png)

For now, you can:
1. Open generate-icons.html in a browser
2. Right-click on each canvas and "Save Image As"
3. Save as icon16.png, icon48.png, icon128.png in the icons/ folder

Or use any icon creation tool to create a shield with checkmark icon in blue colors matching the app theme.

The icons should represent Legal Metrology compliance checking with a professional shield design.
